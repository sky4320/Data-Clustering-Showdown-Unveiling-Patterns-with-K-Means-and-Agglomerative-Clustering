# Data Clustering Showdown: Unveiling Patterns with K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering

## Overview

This project aims to explore the world of data clustering using two powerful techniques: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. Through dynamic visualizations and performance comparisons, we reveal valuable insights and showcase the effectiveness of these methods in identifying patterns within complex datasets.

## Key Features

- Determining the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow Method for K-Means.
- Visualizing and comparing predicted and actual labels using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Evaluating the performance of K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering with confusion matrices.
- Exploring various linkage methods (complete and average) and similarity measures (cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan) for Agglomerative Clustering.
- Comprehensive reporting of precision, recall, and F1 scores for model assessment.

## Why is this Project Useful?

- **Pattern Recognition:** Clustering is an essential data analysis technique that helps identify inherent patterns or structures within large datasets.

- **Algorithm Comparison:** This project showcases the strengths and weaknesses of two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering.

- **Decision Support:** Insights from this project can be used for informed decision-making across various domains, including marketing, finance, and healthcare.

- **Skill Demonstration:** For aspiring data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts, this project provides an excellent opportunity to practice data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and model evaluation.

- **Educational Tool:** This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the practical implementation of clustering algorithms.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`

Install these libraries using `pip` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install seaborn numpy pandas sci-kit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
- **Elbow Method and K-Means Clustering:** Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow Method by running the .ipynb notebook.

- **Visualizing Clustering Results:** Explore dynamic visualizations of predicted versus actual training labels for both K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering in .ipynb notebook.

- **Comparing Clustering Algorithms:** Evaluate the performance of K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering, compare precision, recall, and F1 scores, and visualize results in the .ipynb notebook.

- **Note:** We worked on two data sets and we mentioned it in the repo, please change the datasets accordingly.
